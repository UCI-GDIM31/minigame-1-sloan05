## Devlog
When comparing the relationships between a game's Components, it's GameObjects, and it's Scenes it's best to think of it in ascending order of what comes first when creating the game: Components -> GameObjects -> Scenes. Components make up the properties of the GameObjects. These can be things like a rig, or a collider placed within an object. GameObjects make up the properties of the Scenes in a game. Those properties in the scene can be either a tree, or a house; any object, or prop within the game. And Scenes are just specific sections in a game, or within a game's story.
